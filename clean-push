#   Avoid rebase hell: squashing without rebasing Â· The Odd Bit
#   https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2019-06-17-avoid-rebase-hell-squashing-wi/
#
# With some improvements:
#   - Streamlining: automate as much as possible
#   - Doesn't hardwire the name of the 'master' branch
#     (allows user-override, then falls-back on 'master', 'main')
#   - Adds many safety checks
#   - Good error messages in case something goes wrong
#   - No prompting for steps that don't need human intervention
#   - Ability to review and edit steps before execution
#
# pragma to protect from some of my githooks trying to execute this:

#
# script-cmd is the work-horse of this script.
# 'main' can be simply a sequence of multiple calls to it.
#
# It runs a predetermined sequence of shell commands in order
# while pausing at each step and allowing the user to talk, explain,
# rethink, and even edit/correct the command before finally
# executing it when hitting the [return] key.
#
# It also supports an explanation/comment arg for each command executed.
#
# It has 3 goals:
#   1) Ensure we get all the little details of a sequence right and
#      never make a mistake during an actual demo or presentation
#   2) Save time typing stuff
#   3) Anyone else can reproduce what we did perfectly in their own env.
#
# Usage:
#   script-cmd [options] 'header/explanation string'  'command string'
#   options (disable switches):
#       -p  don't pause for user to hit [enter]
#       -h  don't print the header-string
#       -s  don't advance the step
#       -e  don't echo the command (be silent), just execute
#       -c  don't execute the command
#       -a  abort on any error in command
